                        Lewis is an absolute asset to our team, and it&apos;s a joy to work alongside him. He is incredibly diligent,
                        patient and has great attention to detail, making him an excellent pairing companion.
                        I&apos;ve learnt a lot from our time working together, and I have no doubt that Lewis will make a similarly
                        impactful contribution to any other engineering roles that he takes on in the future.
